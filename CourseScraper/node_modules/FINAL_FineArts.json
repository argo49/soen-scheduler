All production aspects surrounding such endeavors will be explored. Class will start in Montreal on May 19, 20, 22 and 23 and will be followed with a stay of 7 days in Stratford, Ontario. This class will end back in Montreal with a final individual research presentation on August 4 and 5.

Students will develop strategies for making contextural work with real materials in a world that is on the one hand overwhelmed by stuff, and on the other, abandoning the physical in favor of the digital (the online). Students will explore how small ideas grow and become sustainable, with studies ranging from everyday routines to the theory and pragmatics of public art.",

The ways we acquire and possess food, transport and transform it, consume and dispose of it, all construct our social and physical environments. Yet these foodways are also dependent on societal and cultural norms, and collectively form what might be called the food system(s). This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to food creation and consumption, including such fine arts practices as design and architecture, and examines the connections between daily practice and global patterns. The goal is to understand why food is much more complex than we conventionally assume, and how it provides insight into the values and practices of individuals, communities, and nations.",

Our study will begin with examples of earlier games and their role as material culture. We will then reconsider the roles played by the art, the artist and the player/gamer as they are situated at the intersection between art, play and technology.

        "Credits": 3,
        "Special Note": "Informal Architecture: Unregulated Space and the Aesthetics of Resistance. On September 17, 2011 the first Occupy protest to receive national media coverage in the USA, Occupy Wall Street, set up in New York City’s Zuccotti Park. By October 15, the colourful aggregation of tents, tarpaulins, lawn furniture, and hand-painted banners, that gave form to the protest villages, filled parks and parking lots in hundreds of cities in eighty-two countries. The goal of Informal Architecture is to understand Occupy within a history of spatial and built resistance, an activity that is often as much a function of necessity as it is an act of political and social activism. Beginning in the 1930s and ending in the present day, the course will examine developments such as, the incredible 14-story, self-governed, Kowloon Walled City, and the Tent City encampments in Washington, Seattle, and Toronto. While most informal settlements are deemed illegal by governing bodies, many persist - albeit precariously at the interstice of shifting political agendas - and overtime construct schools and even healthcare facilities. A few, such as Portland’s Dignity City, Germany’s Schöner Garten, and Berlin’s Squat Scene, find acceptance within a city’s self-image and eventually achieve official recognition. What are the various factors that conspire in the formation of informal architecture? To answer this question, we will explore the artistry and invention behind the aesthetics and spaces of these fascinating constructions, and how popular reception in film, art, news and other media, contribute to the resistance, persistence, and/or termination of informal architecture.

By working with various types of documentation, including photography, video and digital media, these materials respond to the accumulation of individual’s everyday life and the detached consciousness of singularity. The confinement of personal routines can be re-contextualized to form a language that challenges the cognition of time, space and individuality. The class will provide a playground for such exchanges, experimentation, processes and the embodiment of uncertainty. From vague intention to seemingly recreated banality, the course pushes students to form a structure that will define the once drifting ideas of creation.",

Students will be encouraged to incorporate print media processes (such as screenprinting, lithography, intaglio and digital media) into their projects as well as to consider the traditional print-related practices of editioning and multiple-making as a possibility for book structures. This course examines the book as a format for conceptual and expressive possibilities. Examples of historical and contemporary book works will be discussed to contextualize course projects and workshops with the objective of examining the broad definition of the terms “artist book” or “book art”.",

It’s a course about how theatre artists, oral historians, documentary media artists, and others interested in social innovation, animation, and activism might meet and explore social change within Montreal neighbourhoods. For the Fall 2014 term, the class is continuing our collaboration with the historic Atwater Library and Computer Centre and joining their work in the neighbourhood of Point St.Charles.",
